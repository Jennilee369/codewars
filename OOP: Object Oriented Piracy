Ahoy matey!

You are a leader of a small pirate crew. And you have a plan. With the help of OOP you wish to make a pretty efficient system to identify ships with heavy booty on board!

Unfortunately for you, people weigh a lot these days, so how do you know if a ship is full of gold and not people?

You begin with writing a generic Ship class / struct:

class Ship {
  constructor(draft, crew) {
    this.draft = draft
    this.crew = crew
  }
}
Every time your spies see a new ship enter the dock, they will create a new ship object based on their observations:




answers:

function Ship(draft, crew) {
    this.draft = draft
    this.crew = crew
  }
  
Ship.prototype.isWorthIt = function() {
  return this.draft - this.crew  * 1.5 > 20
}
